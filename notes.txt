Thoughts and Ideas for Project
------------------------------

multiple worlds, each one being it's own standalone game

skills like eso?
similarity to free realms

currency/token rewards for each universe that can't be used on different universes, yet tradeable between players

random events handled by admins? can be kind of DM-like

questboards with randomly??, maybe, generated quests (similar to how Elite Dangerous handles it?)
  - EQUAL REWARDS FOR TIME INVESTED
    - 5 min quest = 5g
    - 10 min quest = 10g
    - 60 min quest = 60g
  - trying to think of a way to NOT suffer the same fate as Sea of Thieves
    - what happened with sea of thieves, is it just the lack of things to do?
    - lack of variety in quests
    - lack of variety in enemies
    - lack of variety in purchasable rewards
