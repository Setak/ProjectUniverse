Thoughts and Ideas for Project
------------------------------

multiple worlds, each one being it's own standalone game

skills like eso?
similarity to free realms

currency/token rewards for each universe that can't be used on different universes, yet tradeable between players

random events handled by admins? can be kind of DM-like

questboards with randomly??, maybe, generated quests (similar to how Elite Dangerous handles it?)
  - EQUAL REWARDS FOR TIME INVESTED
    - 5 min quest = 5g
    - 10 min quest = 10g
    - 60 min quest = 60g
  - trying to think of a way to NOT suffer the same fate as Sea of Thieves
    - what happened with sea of thieves, is it just the lack of things to do?
    - lack of variety in quests
    - lack of variety in enemies
    - lack of variety in purchasable rewards

Dungeons - you have to kill all enemies on a level to proceed to the next, play with spawn times and make it variable depending on # of people on the level, to keep it fair for all group sizes

Worlds Ideas

Wild West World
Fantasy World
Racing World

Teleportation to different worlds? Would like a cost associated

Character Ideas
---------------

Levels 1 - 100

Level 1
HP: 25

Level 100
HP: 2500?

XP Needed from Level 1 > 2 = 1000xp, with an increasing curve, plan is to make levels take awhile

Death - you lose everything on you, but retain your bank
Storage is Unlimited?
How do we make storage almost unimportant, we do NOT want inventory management the game
